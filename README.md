 Exercise 04

Kristen Marcinek and Tristan Sallin

Challenges:

1. Make it so the plane can create and launch items forward towards some target (i.e. it can shoot stuff). Something should happen when the launched item collides with the other object (e.g. score should increase or something).

2. Make it so the plane will crash if it runs into anything other than the collectable items. When the plane crashes, it should return to its starting position.
